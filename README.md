# VisionAssist: Raspberry Pi 5 + YOLOv11 for the Blind

**VisionAssist** is a real-time object detection system designed to assist visually impaired individuals. Built on a Raspberry Pi 5 and leveraging YOLOv11, it provides audio feedback about the surrounding environment.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Identifies objects in real-time using YOLOv11.
- **Audio Feedback**: Converts detected objects into spoken descriptions.
- **Portable**: Runs efficiently on Raspberry Pi 5 for on-the-go use.
- **Customizable**: Add or modify object classes to suit user needs.

---

## Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Setup Raspberry Pi 5, install dependencies, and configure YOLOv11.
2. **Week 3-4**: Develop audio feedback system using text-to-speech (TTS).
3. **Week 5**: Integrate object detection with audio feedback for real-time use.
4. **Week 6**: Optimize performance for Raspberry Pi 5 and conduct testing.
5. **Week 7**: Finalize the system, document the project, and prepare for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 5
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV, YOLOv11, and a TTS library (e.g., `gTTS` or `pyttsx3`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VisionAssist.git
   cd VisionAssist
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download YOLOv11 weights:
   ```bash
   wget https://path-to-yolov11-weights.pt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Point the Raspberry Pi camera toward the environment.
- The system will detect objects and provide audio feedback via connected speakers or headphones.
